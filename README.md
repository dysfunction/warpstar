A quick learning project to familiarize myself with ~~[Corona SDK](http://www.coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/)~~ [CocoonJS](https://www.ludei.com/tech/cocoonjs) and [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) using [copyrighted images that don't belong to me](http://www.spriters-resource.com/gameboy_advance/kirbmirror/)

The old Corona SDK experiment lives in the **corona** branch.

This is a remake of an [equally infringing game](http://www.java4k.com/index.php?action=games&method=view&gid=72) I wrote in 2006.
