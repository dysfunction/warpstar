**This branch is for experimenting with [CocoonJS](https://www.ludei.com/tech/cocoonjs) and [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/)**

**The master branch contains the Corona/Lua version**

A quick learning project to familiarize myself with [Corona SDK](http://www.coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/) using [copyrighted images that don't belong to me](http://www.spriters-resource.com/gameboy_advance/kirbmirror/)

This is a remake of an [equally infringing game](http://www.java4k.com/index.php?action=games&method=view&gid=72) I wrote in 2006.
